SimpleMPDWrapper
================

#Introduction

I needed a class to interface with MPD for a project. I looked around and found
a simple one at https://packagist.org/packages/mutantlabs/simplempd. However,
that project was a little more complicated that I needed - it packages an
interface class (`SimpleMPDWrapper`) with a REST service provider. I just needed
`SimpleMPDWrapper`, so I forked it & I'm extending it to provide more
functionality.


#Installing it in your project

Right now, the only way is to download files & install them manually. I am going
to set it up on http://packagist.org soon.
